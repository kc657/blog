Excited to be a developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Before settling down in the Bay on May 2017, I lived in Chicago for a year, and a year in Taiwan, and a year.. Long story short, I lived in 8 cities across the globe and visited over 20. I am aiming to visit 30 countries before I turn 30 years old.

I love creating challenging applications to test my creative and technical limitations. Driven with an expectation of excellence, I receive satisfaction by solving complex problems systematically. Development provides a perfect environment for that endeavor and an ever-expanding set of tools to experiment with.
