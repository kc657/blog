Twelve weeks at General Assembly’s developer bootcamp passed by faster than I had anticipated. From learning the basic logical operators on week one to tackling longest common subsequence algorithms for my final project, I am proud of how much I have learned. But my one regret was not documenting my experience throughout. Following the old Chinese proverb: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now", here is my first post with three advice for anyone considering a developer bootcamp.


#### 1. Apply In-Class Material to Real World Situations

Classwork is great for building a foundational understanding but seeing how companies applied it to products and services helped me learn a lot faster. Some of my favorite events were hosted by IBM, such as their Watson Conversation meetup and the Loopback-Bluemix Hackathon. By participating and learning at their events, I felt confident implementing IBM Watson’s APIs for my final project. I’ll write a separate post about the speech recognition and scoring app in a week.

#### 2. Docendo Discimus

Latin for “by teaching, we learn”. Everyone in my class had unique strengths and weaknesses. I found that I learned a lot faster when I was able to offer help and explain topics I thought I understood. Since React clicked for me, I was able to dig into the documentation a little more and assist my classmates with any questions they had. Teaching also helped identify when I was being overconfident and needed to do more research since my explanations were not as clear and concise as I wanted.

#### 3. Don’t Worry About This..

..unless it is in the context of this. For any non-developers, you must forgive me for that terrible JavaScript joke. Class moves at a fast pace and many people do freak out. I know I certainly did for the first half. However, everyone survived and we all learned a lot. More importantly, we laughed a lot while learning a lot. So in hindsight, the struggles I faced throughout the 12 weeks was easily dwarfed by the joy it brought me.

Thank you for taking the time to read my first post! I realized my first blog post also serves as a memo to myself. I will continue to learn beyond my workplace, teach others when I can, and enjoy the experience throughout.
