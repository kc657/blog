In the face of insurmountable odds, we were nevertheless posed the age old question that has puzzled countless generations of small business owners: what can we do to help save time or money? But puzzle no more! During Intuit’s Small Business Hackathon,  our team, which consisted of three other developers I met there, racked our brains and saw a common problem when working with smaller businesses: documentation.

Small technical companies lack the manpower or data to create the perfect documentation for their customers. Developer-written documentation, which is most common for startups, usually turn out convoluted and horribly written because the developers simply understand their product too well. They are unable to strip away the inadvertent assumptions an internal developer can make and take the user’s point of view. Our team believes integrating a chatbot into the documentation process can bridge developers writing the documentation and the users that navigate it.

A documentation chatbot powered by actionable analytics is what we needed to create in 24 hours. We used DialogFlow and a custom webhook to build a natural and rich conversational experiences. Next, we integrated our DialogFlow chatbot with Dashbot, a platform that provides actionable bot analytics. Dashbot became the center of our solution because of the data we were able to extract from it. Data such as conversational flow and top intents highlight how users are interacting with our documentation. In the example below, our bot served a lot more customers with the intent of using our Slack documentation instead of Facebook. In addition, users hit the found_bug intent 11 times. By setting up an intent that recognizes when user is talking about a bug in the documentation process, we can take action and fix it.

So how do we fix it? Dashbot, staying true to their motto of 'actionable analytics', has a nifty feature called intent funnel. Intent funnel, in the picture below, shows us what was the interaction prior and after the intent was triggered. In the example below, we see that 11 users triggered the found_bug intent in our chatbot when the chatbot serves a piece of documentation about accessing an API key. Thus, giving small businesses the chance to fix that piece of information in their documentation and improve their customers' experience. Last little feature we found to be awesome for small businesses is the alert function. Alert can send a webhook, email, or text whenever an event is triggered. So we setup a email alert whenever our found_bug intent was triggered, giving us instant data when a customer needs help.

We call our solution DocuBot. Serving customers easy-to-use documentation and providing companies data to improve on their documentation. We see this sort of documentation chatbot applicable to non-technical companies as well. Ikea, for example, can see where customers are struggling when following their manuals. Then, they can take action and improve on specific parts of the manual where a this_picture_doesnt_tell_me_anything_and_all_the_screws_look_the_same intent is triggered.

If you want to understand the custom DialogFlow webhook, feel free to check out [DocuBot Github](https://github.com/kc657/DocuBot-chatbot). We hosted our webhook function on Firebase. I'll write an post that dives deeper into creating a chatbot with intents, entities, and webhooks since it deserves its own post (stay tuned for more). Now since you’re all dying to know, no - we didn’t win and take home a prize of $5000.  My teammates and I have talked about it and after a great deal of discussion, we decided that it’s okay. Life isn’t always about winning. Sometime’s it’s about the journey, not the destination. Smell the roses and all that. Maybe the world just isn’t ready for us. That’s cool. But in all seriousness, it was awesome to see 31 teams working on solutions to help small businesses. Looking out for the little guy - it’s great. Huge shout out to Intuit, Google, Dashbot, and my awesome teammates for making this amazing weekend possible.
