#### I am proud to present [Articulat.in](https://articulatin.herokuapp.com)! Here is the story behind this application:

For my final project at General Assemblyâ€™s developer bootcamp, I decided to create an ambitious application that merged IBM Watson capabilities with React functionality. I mentioned in my previous [blog post](https://kevinchen.netlify.com/post/first/) that I attended a few IBM meetups/hackathon. Having learned so much in these events, a big goal for the final project was to demonstrate my ability to merge skills and technology I learned on my own with in-class material.![undefined](/img/blog/image1 (1).JPG)
