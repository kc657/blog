#### I am proud to present [Articulat.in](https://articulatin.herokuapp.com)! Here is the story behind this application:

For my final project at General Assemblyâ€™s developer bootcamp, I decided to create an ambitious application that merged IBM Watson capabilities with React functionality. I mentioned in my previous [blog post](https://kevinchen.netlify.com/post/first/) that I attended a few IBM meetups/hackathon. Having learned a lot in these events, a big goal for the final project was to demonstrate my ability to merge skills and technology I learned on my own with in-class material. The vessel to deliver my goal was an app that analyzed text differential of a written transcript and a user's voice recording. By doing so, algorithms could provide insight on how well the user memorized the original transcript prior to a big presentation.

The first challenge was to teach myself the ins and outs of Watson's [Speech-to-Text](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/speech-to-text/) service. Having used the Conversation and Loopback services prior, I was confident in my ability to dissect IBM's documentation. I built the first feasibility test using plain JavaScript and got it to translate my "Hello World" voice input onto the screen! The reason I took the time to build it out on plain JavaScript was for two reasons. First, I didn't want to combine React.js library with a unfamiliar API. It would be faster to debug if I ran into any issues. The second reason was to
